# Midterm

* This is my first time doing documentation in this manner so apologies if it isn't well documented *

## Breathing Exercise

I wanted to create a breathing simulation utilizing the current sills that we learned


## Process

For loop to create ellipses/circles based on location on square

Have timeline that would adjust ellipses/circles via radius

Push all these into an array to be displayed via timer


## Desired Improvment

I'd like to: 
    Have some designated color pallettes
    Create more interactivity by changing the size and of a more transparent rectangle
